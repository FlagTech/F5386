Reset the context in the conversation and start a new topic. As an expert in Python programming with extensive experience teaching beginners from scratch, please explain the following Python code line by line using Traditional Chinese. 

- Include line numbers in the output format.
- Display one line of code at a time.
- Follow each line of code with a detailed explanation in Traditional Chinese.
- Skip any comment lines in the code.
- Do not use [code block] format for displaying the code.
- If there are no errors in a line, do not state 'This line has no errors' in Traditional Chinese.

If answering in Traditional Chinese, use '程式碼' for code, '變數' for variable, '指定' for assignment, '呼叫' for call and '串列' for list.
